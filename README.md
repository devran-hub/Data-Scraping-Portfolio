# Data-Scraping-Portfolio
This repository contains my past projects of data scraping with their explanation.
I will keep adding projects like that.

Before looking at this repository let me introduce myself:

I can do web scrapping projects using Python with BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Numpy, Pandas and Regular Expression libraries. I am also familiar with Google Sheets API and i can create a scheduled web scraper script which can scrape datas from web each certain timeframe.

I can:

● Scrape data from whatever websites you want

● Store them in excel, JSON, CSV, google sheet or other databases

● Also work with APIs during data scraping work if it is necessary

● Create a script which scrapes data in a speciic timeframe (every day / hours / 15 minutes / 3 days)

● Automate projects with google products (Google Sheets, Google Docs etc.)

# TechStars Mentors data scraper into excel

 A webscraper that scrapes mentors' name, company and their Linkedin profile link into excel file.
